# Differenciacing-in-Python-Simulation

This time, I would like to do differencing for time series simulation in Python. Differencing is used to remove seasonality which is usually founded in time series. Following previous decomposing simulation from this dataset [us-airlines-monthly-aircraft-miles-flown.csv](https://github.com/altheanabila/Differenciacing-in-Python-Simulation/blob/main/us-airlines-monthly-aircraft-miles-flown.csv), we run the differencing process in Jupyter Notebook.

1. After doing a process of decomposition, we continue to display the lag values of the time series data

2. Display the difference

3. Plotting a decomposition plot, just to make sure

4. Display the plot after using lag 1 differencing, red box indicated we have successfully removed the trend

5. As we can see, we need to remove the seasonality, by running the second differencing

6. Plot the result thoroughly

7. Showing the table of all differencing result
